Advance Payment Flow:
# Only deduct wallet when new advance payment is added (or when advance amount increases).
Not when:
    invoice is edited without payment change
    invoice items are edited
    invoice is saved again with same advance
    invoice status changes but advance already deducted

#Edit Invoice
Compare old advance vs new advance

Case	Action
Advance unchanged	❌ Do nothing
Advance increased	➖ Deduct difference
Advance reduced	    ➕ Add back difference
Advance removed	    ➕ Add back full amount
